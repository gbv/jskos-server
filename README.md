## Install

### Dependencies
You need to have access to a [MongoDB database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

### Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbv/jskos-server.git
cd jskos-server
npm install
```

### Configuration
You can customize the application settings via a configuration file. By default, this configuration file resides in `config/config.json`. However, it is possible to adjust this path via the `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable. Note that the given path has to be either absolute (i.e. starting with `/`) or relative to the `config/` folder (i.e. it defaults to `./config.json`). **Note** that the path to the configuration file needs to be valid and writable because a `namespace` key will be generated and written to the file if it doesn't currently exist.

Currently, there are only two environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV` - either `development` (default) or `production`; currently, the only difference is that in `production`, HTTPS URIs are forced for entities created on POST requests.
- `CONFIG_FILE` - alternate path to a configuration file, relative to the `config/` folder; defaults to `./config.json`.

You can either provide the environment variables during the command to start the server, or in a `.env` file in the root folder.

It is also possible to have more specific configuration based on the environment. These are set in `config/config.development.json` or `config/config.production.json`. Values from these files have precedent over the user configuration.

All missing keys will be defaulted from `config/config.default.json`:

```json
{
  "verbosity": false,
  "baseUrl": null,
  "title": "JSKOS Server",
  "version": null,
  "port": 3000,
  "proxies": [],
  "mongo": {
    "user": "",
    "pass": "",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017,
    "db": "jskos-server",
    "options": {
      "reconnectTries": 5,
      "reconnectInterval": 1000,
      "useNewUrlParser": true
    }
  },
  "auth": {
    "algorithm": "RS256",
    "key": null
  },
  "schemes": true,
  "concepts": true,
  "mappings": {
    "read": {
      "auth": false
    },
    "create": {
      "auth": true
    },
    "update": {
      "auth": true,
      "crossUser": false
    },
    "delete": {
      "auth": true,
      "crossUser": false
    },
    "fromSchemeWhitelist": null,
    "toSchemeWhitelist": null,
    "anonymous": false,
    "cardinality": "1-to-n"
  },
  "concordances": true,
  "annotations": {
    "read": {
      "auth": false
    },
    "create": {
      "auth": true
    },
    "update": {
      "auth": true,
      "crossUser": false
    },
    "delete": {
      "auth": true,
      "crossUser": false
    }
  },
  "identityProviders": null,
  "identities": null,
  "ips": null
}
```

With the keys `schemes`, `concepts`, `mappings`, and `annotations`, you can configure whether endpoints related to the specific functionality should be available. A minimal configuration file to just server read-only vocabulary and concept information could look like this:

```json
{
  "mappings": false,
  "annotations": false,
  "concordances": false
}
```

Available actions for `schemes`, `concepts`, `mappings`, and `annotations` are `read`, `create`, `update`, and `delete`. By default, all types can be read, while `mappings` and `annotations` can be created, updated, and deleted with authentication. Explanantions for additional options:

- **`auth`**: Boolean. Can be defined only on actions. Defines whether access will require [authentication via JWT](#authentication). By default `false` for `read`, and `true` for all other actions.

- **`crossUser`**: Boolean. Can be defined only on `update` and `delete` actions. Defines whether it is possible to edit an entity from a different user than the authenticated one. `false` by default.

- **`anonymous`**: Boolean. Can be defined only on type `mappings`. If `true`, the creator for mappings will not be saved. Also, `crossUser` will be implied to `true` as well. `false` by default.

- **`cardinality`**: String. Can be defined only on type `mappings`. Currently possible values: `1-to-n` (default), `1-to-1`. If `1-to-1` is configured, mappings with multiple concepts in `to` will be rejected.

- **`identities`**: List of URI strings. Can be defined on any level (deeper levels will take the values from higher levels if necessary\*). If set, an action can only be used by users with an URI given in the list. `null` by default (no restrictions).

- **`identityProviders`**: List of strings. Can be defined on any level (deeper levels will take the values from higher levels if necessary\*). If set, an action can only be used by users who have that identity associated with them. `null` by default (no restrictions).

- **`ips`**: List of strings. Strings can be IPv4 addresses (e.g. `127.0.0.1`, `123.234.123.234`) or CIDR ranges (e.g. `192.168.0.1/24`). Can be defined on any level (deeper levels will take the values from higher levels if necessary\*). If set, an action can only be used by clients with a whitelisted IP address. `null` by default (no restrictions). Note: An empty array will allow all IPs. Note: This property will be removed for security reasons when accessing [GET /status](#get-status) (meaning that clients will not be able to see the whitelisted IP addresses).

- **`fromSchemeWhitelist`/`toSchemeWhitelist`**: Can be defined only on type `mappings`. List of scheme objects that are allowed for `fromScheme`/`toScheme` respectively. `null` allows all schemes.

\* Only applies to actions `create`, `update`, and `delete`.

Note that any properties not mentioned here are not allowed!

Here are some helpful example presets for "mappings" or "annotations".

**Read-only access (does not make sense for annotations):**
```json
{
  "read": {
    "auth": false
  }
}
```

**Anyone can create, but only logged-in users can update and delete (and only their own items):**
```json
{
  "read": {
    "auth": false
  },
  "create": {
    "auth": false
  },
  "update": {
    "auth": true,
    "crossUser": false
  },
  "delete": {
    "auth": true,
    "crossUser": false
  }
}
```

**Anyone can create, logged-in users can update (independent of creator), logged-in users can delete their own items:**
```json
{
  "read": {
    "auth": false
  },
  "create": {
    "auth": false
  },
  "update": {
    "auth": true,
    "crossUser": true
  },
  "delete": {
    "auth": true,
    "crossUser": false
  }
}
```

**Anyone can create, as well as update and delete, independent of creator:**
```json
{
  "read": {
    "auth": false
  },
  "create": {
    "auth": false
  },
  "update": {
    "auth": false,
    "crossUser": true
  },
  "delete": {
    "auth": false,
    "crossUser": true
  }
}
```

If write access for concept schemes and/or concepts is necessary, it is recommended that they are secured by only allowing certain users (via `identities`) or only allowing certain IP addresses (via `ips`):


**Only user with URI `https://coli-conc.gbv.de/login/users/c0c1914a-f9d6-4b92-a624-bf44118b6619` can write:**
```json
{
  "read": {
    "auth": false
  },
  "create": {
    "auth": true,
    "identities": ["https://coli-conc.gbv.de/login/users/c0c1914a-f9d6-4b92-a624-bf44118b6619"]
  },
  "update": {
    "auth": true,
    "identities": ["https://coli-conc.gbv.de/login/users/c0c1914a-f9d6-4b92-a624-bf44118b6619"]
  },
  "delete": {
    "auth": true,
    "identities": ["https://coli-conc.gbv.de/login/users/c0c1914a-f9d6-4b92-a624-bf44118b6619"]
  }
}
```

**Only localhost can write:**

```json
{
  "read": {
    "auth": false
  },
  "create": {
    "auth": false,
    "ips": ["127.0.0.1"]
  },
  "update": {
    "auth": false,
    "ips": ["127.0.0.1"]
  },
  "delete": {
    "auth": false,
    "ips": ["127.0.0.1"]
  }
}
```
Note that `auth` is set to `false` because it refers to authentication via JWT. The IP filter is separate from that. An even more secure way would be to use both JWT authentication with an `identities` filter as well as an IP filter.

---

**If you are using jskos-server behind a proxy, it is necessary to provide the `baseUrl` key as well as the `proxies` key in your configuration (example for our production API):**
```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://coli-conc.gbv.de/api/",
  "proxies": ["123.456.789.101", "234.567.891.011"]
}
```

### Authentication
It is possible to limit certain actions to authenticated users, indicated by the `auth` option (see example configurations above). Authorization is performed via JWTs ([JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/)). To configure authentication, you need to provide the JWT algorithm and the key/secret in the configuration file, like this:

```json
"auth": {
  "algorithm": "RS256",
  "key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA57ZWRoOjXYTQ9yujxAu7\ne3k4+JRBAqGdDVIRRq5vXB2D5nJBIhQjVjylumn+QnTX/MdZx8qn7X96npUwHwIh\nylCgUmsYXcjP08X/AXEcP5bPOkgBBCKjWmcm+p01RQSOM0nSptyxpyXzr2ppWe1b\nuYdRYDWj+JV7vm+jJA4NiFv4UnAhoG5lRATADzu0/6wpMK3dVMBL7L0jQoV5xBAb\nLADOy5hD9XEII3VPkUqDGIKM+Z24flkCIf0lQ7FjsoZ2mmM1SZJ5vPDcjMKreFkX\ncWlcwGHN0PUWZWLhb7c8yYa1rauMcwFwv0d2XyOEfgkqEJdCh8mVT/5jR48D2PNG\ncwIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
}
```

The JWT has to be provided as a Bearer token in the authorization header, e.g. `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Currently, all authorized endpoints will be accessible (although `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` are limited to the user who created the object by default), but later it will be possible to set scopes for certain users (see [#47](https://github.com/gbv/jskos-server/issues/47)).

The authentication is designed to be used together with an instance of [login-server], but it is also possible to use your own JWTs.

#### JWT Example
The recommended Node.js library for creating JWTs is [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken). Note that for simplicity, we are using the HS256 algorithm which is symmetrical. In most cases, it would be better to use RS256 with a libarary like [node-rsa](https://github.com/rzcoder/node-rsa) instead.

Simple config, restricting the `/mappings` endpoint with authentication:
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "algorith": "HS256",
    "key": "yoursecret"
  },
  "mappings": {
    "read": {
      "auth": true
    }
  }
}
```

Creating a JWT:
```js
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")
// Payload is an object containing the user object with an URI:
const data = {
  user: { uri: "test:hallo" }
}
// Sign the token with our secret
const token = jwt.sign(data, "yoursecret", {
  algorithm: "HS256",
  expiresIn: "7d" // valid for 7 days
})
```

Using the token in a request (using curl):
```bash
# Request without header should return ForbiddenAccessError (code 403)
curl localhost:3000/mappings
# Request with header should return JSON data (insert your own token and jskos-server URL of course)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjp7InVyaSI6InRlc3Q6aGFsbG8ifSwiaWF0IjoxNTg5NTMyNDU3LCJleHAiOjE1OTAxMzcyNTd9.fXIxgS0QyFk9Lvz7Z-fkb4tAueMTSNZ4zAuB6iwePq4" localhost:3000/mappings
```

If you are the only user that is supposed to be authenticated for your instance of jskos-server, you could in theory use something like this to create a token with a long lifetime and use it for all your requests. Please consider the security implications before doing this though.

#### Login Server Example
If you have multiple users using your instance of jskos-server, it is recommended to use [login-server] for authentication. login-server uses the asymmetrical RS256 algorithm by default and will create a public/private key pair on first launch. The public key will be in `./public.key` and you will need that for the configuration:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "algorith": "RS256",
    "key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA57ZWRoOjXYTQ9yujxAu7\ne3k4+JRBAqGdDVIRRq5vXB2D5nJBIhQjVjylumn+QnTX/MdZx8qn7X96npUwHwIh\nylCgUmsYXcjP08X/AXEcP5bPOkgBBCKjWmcm+p01RQSOM0nSptyxpyXzr2ppWe1b\nuYdRYDWj+JV7vm+jJA4NiFv4UnAhoG5lRATADzu0/6wpMK3dVMBL7L0jQoV5xBAb\nLADOy5hD9XEII3VPkUqDGIKM+Z24flkCIf0lQ7FjsoZ2mmM1SZJ5vPDcjMKreFkX\ncWlcwGHN0PUWZWLhb7c8yYa1rauMcwFwv0d2XyOEfgkqEJdCh8mVT/5jR48D2PNG\ncwIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
  }
}
```

After that, you can use [login-client](https://github.com/gbv/login-client) to interact with your login-server instance and receive JWTs. When using WebSockets, login-server will periodically send a new JWT before the previous one expires. You can then use that to authenticate your requests to jskos-server. (An example on how to use login-client can be found in the [source code of login-server](https://github.com/gbv/login-server/blob/master/views/api.ejs).)

For testing your authentication without a full-fledged solution using login-client, you can use http://localhost:3004/token (where `localhost:3004` is your instance of login-server) to request a JWT.

---

Note about previous additional options for `auth`:
- `postAuthRequired`: now covered by `mappings.create.auth`
- `whitelist`: now covered by `identities`
- `allowCrossUserEditing`: now covered by `mappings.update.crossUser` and `mappings.delete.crossUser`

### Data Import
JSKOS Server provides a script to import JSKOS data into the database. Right now, mappings, terminologies (concept schemes), concepts, concordances, and annotations, in JSON (array only) or [NDJSON](http://ndjson.org) format are supported.

Before you can use the script, you need to link it: `npm link`. This makes the command `jskos-import` available in your path. To see how to use the script, run `jskos-import --help`. **Note:** If you have multiple jskos-server instances running on the same machine, this command will make the import for the **current** instance available in the path. Alternatively, you can use `./bin/import.js` or `npm run import --`.

Examples:
```bash
# Linking is necessary to be able to use the `jskos-import` command.
npm link
# Alternatively, replace `jskos-import` with `./bin/import.js` or `npm run import --`. This is recommended for cronjobs etc.

# Create indexes for all types
jskos-import --indexes
# Import RVK scheme (from coli-conc API)
jskos-import schemes https://coli-conc.gbv.de/rvk/api/voc
# Import RVK concepts (this might take a while)
jskos-import concepts https://coli-conc.gbv.de/rvk/data/2019_1/rvko_2019_1.ndjson
# Import coli-conc concordances
jskos-import concordances https://coli-conc.gbv.de/concordances/csv/concordances.ndjson

# Batch import multiple files or URLs
npm run import-batch -- mappings files.txt
# files.txt should contain one file or URL per line with the full path and no escaping.
# You can, for example, store these batch import files in folder `imports` which is ignored in git.
```

**Note: If you have concepts in your database, make sure to run `jskos-import --indexes` at least once. This will make sure all necessary indexes are created. Without this step, the `/suggest` and `/search` endpoints will not work.**

Note about hierarchy for concepts: jskos-server solely uses the `broader` field on concepts to determine the hierarchy. The `narrower` field will be dynamically filled for every request, and `ancestors` are determined via requests to [`GET /ancestors`](#get-ancestors) or via `properties=ancestors`. If there is data already inside the `narrower` or `ancestors` fields, it will be ignored.

## Usage

### Run Server
```bash
# Development server with hot reload and auto reconnect at localhost:3000 (default)
npm run start

# To run the server in production, run this:
NODE_ENV=production node ./server.js
```

### Run Tests
Tests will use the real MongoDB with `-test-${namespace}` appended to the database name.

```bash
npm test
```

## API
Unless otherwise specified:
- `GET` requests will return code 200 on success.
- `POST` requests will return code 201 on success.
- `DELETE` requests will return code 204 on success.
- `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` requests require a JSON body.
- `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` requests require authentication via a JWT from [login-server](https://github.com/gbv/login-server) in the header. Exception: Authentication for certain actions on certain endpoints can be disabled (see [configuration](#configuration)).
- `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` requests are required to come from the owner of the entity that is being modified.
- All URL parameters are optional.
- All `GET` endpoints (except for `/status` and those with `:_id`) offer pagination via `limit=[number]` (default: 100) and `offset=[number]` (default: 0) parameters. In the response, there will be a `Link` header like described in the [GitHub API documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination), as well as a `X-Total-Count` header containing the total number of results.
- For possible errors, see [Errors](#errors).

### GET /status
Returns a status object.

There is a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) for the format of this endpoint. It is available under `/status.schema.json` for every jskos-server installation (starting from version 1.0.0). The most recent schema can be accessed here: https://gbv.github.io/jskos-server/status.schema.json

Note that certain properties from the actual configuration will not be shown in the result for `/status`:
- `verbosity`
- `port`
- `mongo`
- `namespace`
- `proxies`
- `ips` (including inside of actions)
- `auth.key` if a symmetrical algorithm is used (HS256, HS384, HS512)

  }
  ```

### POST /annotations
Saves an annotation or multiple annotations in the database.

* **URL Params**

  `bulk=[boolean]` `1` or `true` enable bulk mode for importing multiple annotations into the database. Errors for individual annotations will be ignored and existing annotations will be overridden. The resulting set will only include the `id` for each annotation that was written into the database.

* **Success Reponse**

  Annotation object or array of object as was saved in the database in [Web Annotation Data Model] format, or array of annotation objects with only a `id` if bulk mode was used.

* **Error Response**

  When a single annotation is provided, an error can be returned if there's something wrong with it (see [errors](#errors)). When multiple annotations are provided, the first error will be returned, except if bulk mode is enabled in which errors for individual annotations are ignored.

### PUT /annotations/:_id
Overwrites an annotation in the database.

* **Success Reponse**

  Annotation object as it was saved in the database in [Web Annotation Data Model] format.

### PATCH /annotations/:_id
Adjusts an annotation in the database.

* **Success Reponse**

  Annotation object as it was saved in the database in [Web Annotation Data Model] format.

### DELETE /annotations/:_id
Deletes an annotation from the database.

* **Success Reponse**

  Status 204, no content.

### Errors
If possible, errors will be returned as a JSON object in the following format (example):

```json
{
  error: "EntityNotFoundError",
  status: 404,
  message: "The requested entity ABC could not be found.",
}
```

The following errors are currently caught and returned as JSON:

#### EntityNotFoundError
Status code 404. Will be returned if `GET /mappings/:_id` or `GET /annotations/:_id` are requested with an unknown ID.

#### MalformedBodyError
Status code 400. Will be returned for `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` if the body was not JSON or missing.

#### MalformedRequestError
Status code 400. Will be returned if a required parameter is missing (currently implemented in `GET /.../:_id` endpoints, but should not be possible to reach).

#### DuplicateEntityError
Status code 422. Will be returned for `POST` if an entity with the same ID/URI already exists in the database.

#### InvalidBodyError
Status code 422. Will be returned for `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` if the body was valid JSON, but could not be validated (e.g. does not pass the JSKOS Schema).

#### CreatorDoesNotMatchError
Status code 403. Will be returned by `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` endpoints if the authenticated creator does not match the creator of the entity that is being edited.

#### DatabaseAccessError
Status code 500. Will be returned if the database is not available or if the current database request failed with an unknown error.

#### ConfigurationError
Status code 500. Will be returned if there is an error in the configuration that prevents the application from working correctly.

#### ForbiddenAccessError
Status code 403. Will be returned if the user is not allow access (i.e. when not on the whitelist or when an identity provider is missing).

## Deployment
The application is currently deployed at http://coli-conc.gbv.de/api/. At the moment, there is no automatic deployment of new versions.

### Notes about depolyment on Ubuntu
It is recommended to use a [newer version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions). Installing the dependencies might also require installing nodejs-legacy: `sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy` ([more info here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21168141/cannot-install-packages-using-node-package-manager-in-ubuntu)). One possibility for running the application in production on Ubuntu 16.04 is described [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04). (Information about restarting pm2-based services on system reboot [here](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/startup/).)

### Update an instances deployed with PM2
```
# get updates from repository
git pull

# install dependencies
npm ci

# restart the process (adjust process name if needed)
pm2 restart jskos-server
```

### Daily Import
If you'd like to run the import script daily to refresh current mappings, you can for example use a cronjob:

```bash
# Runs import script for jskos-server in /srv/cocoda/jskos-server at 1 AM each day.
00 01 * * * cd /srv/cocoda/jskos-server; ./scripts/import.sh
```

### Running Behind a Reverse Proxy
There are certain things to consider when running `jskos-server` behind a reverse proxy:

1. Make sure the base URL is configured correctly in `config.json` so that correct URIs will be generated. Test this by creating a new mapping and making sure the URI of that mapping is correct and accessible.

1. Provide a list of trusted proxy IPs or ranges in the `proxies` key in `config.json`. E.g. `"proxies": ["123.456.789.101", "234.567.891.011"]`. See also: [Express behind proxies](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html).

1. The reverse proxy should be configured so that the base URL has a trailing slash: ~~`https://example.com/api`~~ ❌ - `https://example.com/api/` ✅ (Note: Not implementing this has no further consequences except that `/api` will not be accessible.)

1. The reverse proxy should also be configured so that any URL **except** the base URL has **no** trailing slash: ~~`https://example.com/api/status/`~~ ❌ - `https://example.com/api/status` ✅

1. Make sure the target parameter (i.e. the actual IP and port where `jskos-server` is running) has a trailing slash.

1. Make sure the proxy is configured to correctly set the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

The following would be an example for 2./3./4. with an Apache reverse proxy:

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:8099>
    Define API_PATH /api
    ServerName example.com

    RewriteEngine on
    # Remove trailing slash from everything EXCEPT the base URL
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^${API_PATH}/$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)/+$ $1 [R=301,L]
    # Force trailing slash for base URL only
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^${API_PATH}$
    RewriteRule ^(.+[^/])$ %{REQUEST_URI}/ [R=301,L]

    # Forward to jskos-server
    ProxyPass ${API_PATH}/ http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ProxyPassReverse ${API_PATH}/ http://127.0.0.1:3000/

    # ...
</VirtualHost>
```

<!-- TODO: Add example for nginx. -->
